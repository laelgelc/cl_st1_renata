Speaker Johnson, you can ' t follow Christ and fund full term abortion ' s the 
inconvenient EVERY Republican in my conference that voted for the $1 . 2 
TRILLION woke, trans ideology, DEI, Open Border Policy, abortion ABOMINATION 
omnibus that is upset with me, YOU should be outraged that your Speaker made 
you walk that plank for him in order to pay our military House Republicans are 
lucky, Trump drags us across the line in November and we will still have the 
majority next Congress, but we won ' t win the majority on our job performance!

any reason to want to vote for Republicans after Trump is d, under Speaker 
Johnson the House showed them a future Republican Party that not only did NOT 
listen to its voters, reminded them that the Swamp has its ways and will never 
change unless it is forced.
