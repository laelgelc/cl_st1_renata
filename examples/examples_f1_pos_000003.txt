 Lie, lie, lie. The strategy of the lie is progressives ' new gospel. It is 
what the progressive bible — Saul Alinsky ' s Rules for Radicals — is all 
about. Alinsky understood the mistake Sixties ' radicals had made. His message 
to this generation is easily summed up: Don ' t telegraph your goals; 
infiltrate their institutions and subvert them; moral principles are disposable 
fictions; the end justifies the means; and never forget that your political 
goal is always SDS radical wrote in the Sixties: The issue is never the issue. 
The issue is always the revolution. The Alinsky version is this: The issue is 
never the issue; the issue is always power: How to wring power out of the 
democratic process, how turn the process into an instrument of progressive 
control. **#xteam_h** **#dt47_h** **#truthtrain_h** **#phpnews_h** **#tcd_h**
