UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced that Britons will hold a general 
election on July 4 , the first in 14 years. The far-left Labour Party is 
expected to trounce the conservatives. And honestly, rightly so. Conservatives 
in the UK have been cowardly, feckless, and without vision. Let this be a 
warning to US conservatives. If you govern as Democrat-lite, you will lose 
everything. The people deserve and demand a courageous alternative opposition 
party.
