Kevin McCarthy: Today was a win for every mother, every father, but most 
importantly, for every student in America. You have a Parents Bill of Rights 
now. Today the GOP has passed the Parents Bill of Rights. Parents will have the 
right to:1 . Know what their children are being taught. 2 . Be heard. 3 . See 
the school budget and spending. 4 . Protect their child ' s privacy. 5 . Keep 
their children safe.
