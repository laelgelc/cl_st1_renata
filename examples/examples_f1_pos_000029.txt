 You put them first, said Malcolm X, and they put you last. ' Cause you ' re a 
chump. A political chump! . . . Any time you throw your weight behind a 
political party that controls two-thirds of the government, and that party can 
' t keep the promise that it made to you during election time, and you are dumb 
enough to walk around continuing to identify yourself with that party -- you ' 
re not only a chump but you ' re a traitor to your race. What would Malcolm X 
say about today ' s 95 percent black vote? Did the Democratic Party keep its 
promises to promote family stability, push education and encourage job 
creation? The black community, over the last 50 years, has suffered an 
unparalleled breakdown in family unity. **#xteam_h** **#dt47_h**
