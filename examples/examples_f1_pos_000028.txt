We are never commanded to be pacifists, in the usual sense of the word. Rather, 
we are to hate what is evil and cling to what is good ( Romans 12:9 ) . In 
doing so we must take a stand against evil in this world ( which requires 
conflict ) and pursue righteousness ( 2 Timothy 2:22 ) . Jesus modeled this 
pursuit and never shrank from conflict when it was part of the Father ' s 
sovereign plan. Jesus spoke openly against the religious and political rulers 
of His time because they were not seeking the righteousness of God ( Luke 
13:31–32 ; 19:45–47 ) . **#xteam_h** **#dt47_h** **#truthtrain_h**
