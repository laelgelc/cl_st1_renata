New Hampshire ' s Republican governor believes that the state ' s motto, Live 
Free or Die, refers to local governments not individual human beings. He 
believes your children have no right to breathe unrestrictedly in school, but 
local governments have a right to follow the federal government ' s barbaric 
mask requirements without state input. Likewise, he believes schools have the 
right to secretly engage in grooming of children, but parents have no right to 
know.
