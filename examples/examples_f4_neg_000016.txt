Johnson told House Republicans on a conference call today that GOP leaders 
would offer a pair of stopgap funding bills to avoid a government shutdown next 
first package would extend Agriculture, MilCon-Va, Energy and Water plus 
Transportation-HUD spending until Jan. 19 . The second package would extend the 
other eight appropriations bills until Feb. 2 . Johnson said the fallback
