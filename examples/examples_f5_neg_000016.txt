The idea that we should NOT vote until 2020 is fixed, is absoutely ABSURD. 
Individuals who are spreading this kind of DANGEROUS rhetoric are NOT Patriots, 
but they are infiltrators, disruptors, and is BEYOND reasonable logic to even 
suggest the notion of not voting in such a CRITICAL time in our nations 
history. Even if there is massive fraud in our elections, which clearly is the 
case, that does NOT absolve the FACT that we ALL need to participate in order 
to overwhelm the system.
