While Republicans have just a small majority in the House, we ' ve passed 
legislation to secure our border, promote energy dominance, & more. We have 
stopped Democrats from passing new burdensome regulations, taxes, & excessive 
spending, including tens of billions of dollars in student loan giveaways. Our 
committees have fought to keep the SEC, EPA, & other agencies in check. Our 
Oversight Committee is also the only reason Biden ' s corruption has been 
exposed & evidence has come to light regarding his family ' s pay-to-play 
scheme with foreign nationals. Despite Republicans only controlling the House, 
we have been successful in our efforts to counter Democrat policies that would 
harm America. If we are truly going to grow our economy to outcompete China, 
strengthen our national security, secure our border, and abide by 
Constitutional law, we must take the White House and gain the majority in the 
Senate. If we do that, GOP policies will undoubtedly lead to a more prosperous, 
safer country.
