1 . Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate Majority Leader from New York, seems 
to have a bit of irony up his sleeve when he labeled the GOP-led impeachment 
inquiry into President Joe Biden ' s alleged financial wrongdoings as a ' witch 
hunt. ' It ' s quite amusing considering his own party spent the past eight 
years politically targeting former President Donald Trump.
