The outcome of the 2010 contest, which took nearly a month to resolve, was 
decided by just 74 , 000 out of 8 . 8 million votes, or a margin of 0 . 8 
percentâ€”one of the closest statewide elections in California history. Cooley, 
a moderate Republican, had been the front-runner in most preelection polls, and 
he even declared victory on election night. But the results proved too close to 
call, and Harris eventually prevailed when all provisional and mail-in ballots 
were counted. #xteam_h #dt47_h #truthtrain_h #phpnews_h #tcd_h #nightshift_h
