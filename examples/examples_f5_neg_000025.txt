TRUMP: Ron DeSantis is a young man who is not doing well against me in the 
polls, to put it mildly. I believe that if he decides to run for President, 
which will only hurt and somewhat divide the Republican Party, he will lose the 
cherished and massive MAGA vote, and never be able to successfully run for 
office again.
