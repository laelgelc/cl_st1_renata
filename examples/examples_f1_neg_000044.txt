Our nation was founded on the principle of freedom, but under a Democrat 
one-party rule in Washington, Americans have seen their Constitutional freedoms 
come under attack. Concerned parents are targeted as domestic terrorists, sport 
coaches are fired for silently praying, Big Tech is censoring media to silence 
free speech. When Republicans take back the majority in November, we will 
defend our unalienable rights and ensure that freedom perseveres.
