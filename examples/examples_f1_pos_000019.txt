Starting in the 1960s, academics took heightened interest in Italian Marxist 
Antonio Gramsci ' s cultural Marxism. Members of the political class glommed 
onto the resulting social justice, affirmative action, diversity, 
multiculturalism, political correctness, and other malignancies spawned by 
cultural Marxism. Progressive politicians came to view society as a hodge-podge 
of racial, ethnic, gender-based, and now also sexual orientation-based groups 
locked in zero-sum combat with Western whites. ' Generally speaking, cultural 
Marxism ' s indoctrinees have learned to view morality and knowledge as 
constructs and social and economic power as commodities to be transferred from 
oppressor to oppressed. **#xteam_h** **#dt47_h** **#truthtrain_h**
