In 1993 , months after Senator Mitch McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao, were 
married, the senator from Kentucky found himself in Beijing. But this was no 
typical honeymoon. He was traveling with his wife and new father-in-law, James 
Chao, and they had a series of private meetings with senior Chinese officials, 
including Chinese president Jiang Zemin. Jiang and James Chao had been 
classmates in China decades earlier. The meetings were a major publicity coup 
for Beijing. Tiananmen Square had happened years earlier and few American 
political figures were visiting the country. McConnell was only the second 
Republican U. S. senator to do so. **#xteam_h** **#dt47_h** **#truthtrain_h**
