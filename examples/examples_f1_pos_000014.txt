Integrity ' Former Senator Tom Daschle – a board member of a new dark money, 
left-wing group targeting conservative election integrity lawyers – took a 
trip to China sponsored by a key communist influence group flagged by the U. S. 
government for its efforts to infiltrate American new group – 65 Project –
