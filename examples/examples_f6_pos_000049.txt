from the great Col Allen West-Today is a great and monumental day for these 
United States of America. On Oct. 19 , 1781 , the British officially 
surrendered to Gen. George Washington and effectively ended the War of 
Independence. Yes, today is anniversary of the day that America secured its 
independence. . . kinda like April 21 , 1836 is San Jacinto Day here in Texas. 
Sadly, this nation is too busy indoctrinating and sexualizing our children to 
teach them our exceptional history.
