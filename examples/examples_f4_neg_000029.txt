The party they belong to is not meaningless, tell you why. Because Democrats 
are trying to tell all of their liberal followers and the rest of the world 
that they had nothing to do with slavery in any way and that it was all the 
Republicans faults. Which we all know to not be true. And how reparations need 
to be made. However they do not talk about how it was their own tribes who 
captured them and sold them into slavery in the first place. Or how Democrats 
voted against their freedom and voting.
