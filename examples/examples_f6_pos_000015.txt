For all of you 30k patriots headed to Rock The Country in Ocala, FL this 
weekend, YES, there is gonna be some Florida heat to deal with! I am not one to 
tell people what to do, but what I DO when I am drinking beers on a hot day is 
the 3 / 1 rule…For every 3 beers I drink, I slam one water nerd_face_e 
rainbow_flag_e … . Seriously, that shit works for me! Either way, looking 
forward to rocking out tonight and hanging tomorrow w everyone at RTC! Please 
continue to look out for one another, and of course, have a great fucking time! 
You people attending are what really separates this festival from all the rest! 
Love ya ' ll like cornflakes! God Bless - Kid Rock
