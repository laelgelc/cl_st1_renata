Feel screwed yet? In 1986 , three million illegal immigrants in the United 
States were given the right to become citizens. It was a full-scale amnesty, 
created by a bipartisan majority in Congress and signed into law by President 
Reagan. It had one big flaw. The amnesty went into effect immediately. And 
strong measures to secure the border with Mexico and prosecute employers who 
hired illegals were to follow. The goal was to stop illegal immigration once 
and for all, while allowing those here illegally to stay. But strengthened 
enforcement never happened—that was the flaw—and the bill produced a 
perverse result. Rather than halt the flow of illegal immigrants, the 1986 law 
actually spurred millions more to come. . . #xteam_h #dt47_h #truthtrain_h
