Page Three: Additionally, he ' s not allowing the Monica Lewinsky-style dress 
into the case. E. Jean Carroll said she had a dress, and when we said, OK, use 
it, she didn ' t want to produce it, and the Judge wouldn ' t allow the 
information to be brought in, because there was no information, other than it 
would show my innocence! This Judge should be sanctioned for his abuse of 
powerâ€”No wonder our Country is going to Hell! The second trial is a totally 
separate case from the first one, so the Jury should decide on guilt, which 
does not exist, instead of a reward, which I should get, not her. This Judge is 
not allowing that, he is not allowing me to properly defend myself from false 
accusations, he ' s taking the unfair decision in the first trial, which we are 
appealing, and sticking selected parts of it into this trial. As to guilt or 
innocence, he is wrongfully forcing guilty, which is unAmerican. We have a very 
bad and hostile Judge, but we ' re fighting all the way. MAGA!
