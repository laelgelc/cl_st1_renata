This holiday season, I discovered there are a lot of conservatives who think 
they ' re wizards or otherwise mystics and that that ' s somehow okay. A fair 
definition for conservative is someone who is trying to preserve that which has 
worked for his person, family, and community in the past. Mystics aren ' t 
that. Mystics are trying to transform reality or their perception of reality. 
There ' s a pretty fundamental ' s a weird entitlement under all mysticism, 
which is, in religious language, a fundamental belief that Creation isn ' t 
enough, that there ' s something more hidden beneath the surface. It ' s a dark 
invitation into error and shirking what is for what is wished for but someone 
who practices an internal martial art of China, I see this all the time, both 
the desire and the calamity it causes. There must be secrets, maybe powers, and 
chasing them undermines all real development ( gongfu ) . Big mistake! Many 
such cases!
