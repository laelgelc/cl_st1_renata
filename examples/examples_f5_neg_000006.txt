The generic ballot polls didn ' t magically swing wildly back towards 
Republicans in the last couple weeksThe polls in August and September were just 
suppression polls trying to dampen MAGA enthusiasm after seeing their huge 
advantage earlier in the summerThey tried to shift the national electorate but 
it didn ' t work and now they have to reflect the actual political reality 
right before elections so they don ' t completely humiliate themselves as a 
polling organizationThey do this every cycle
