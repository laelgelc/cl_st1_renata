In High School on Quantico Marine military base, I won a Patriotic essay 
contest. We were to write what patriotism means and what makes a good patriot. 
This was back in 1997 . I won by writing about a unique form of patriot. Of 
course we all wrote about veterans, as all our dad ' s were Marines. So I 
thought hard about other types of patriots. I wrote about Jonas Sulk - the 
inventor of the first effective polio vaccine. The group of hardened Marine 
veteran judges chose me as the winner. He saved countless American lives. 
Little did I know I was writing about who would become the 45th, 46th, and 47th 
President of the USA -- Donald Trump. He doesn ' t get the credit he deserves 
for Operation Warp Speed. He did his part. He ' s a hero! Any malfeasance rests 
solely on Quack Fauci and his gang of thieves. End of story!
