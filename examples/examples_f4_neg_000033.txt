New J6 Footage Shows Ray Epps Whispering To ' Baked Alaska ' : We ' re Here To 
Storm The Capitol In the first of a two-part series, Truth in Media host Lara 
Logan spoke with Anthime Gionet, also known as Baked Alaska, a right-wing 
influencer formerly associated with the alt right. Video footage from January 5 
, 2021 and earlier indicate that Epps appeared to be particularly interested in 
Gionet, who was later sentenced to two months in prison for his participation 
in the riot at the US ( Baked Alaska ) was one of several people who filmed 
Epps on the evening of January 5 , 2021 outside BLM Plaza as he told Trump 
supporters we need to go into the Capitol! At first, Gionet said he was amused 
by Epps ' exhortation to breach the Capitol, and yelled ' let ' s go! ' in 
response, but after he saw him repeat the line several times to different 
groups that night, he became convinced the boomer was an FBI plant and was up 
to no: / /
