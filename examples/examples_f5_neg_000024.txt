Ron DeSantis is a young man who is not doing well against me in the polls, to 
put it mildly. I believe that if he decides to run for President, which will 
only hurt and somewhat divide the Republican Party, he will lose the cherished 
and massive MAGA vote, and never be able to successfully run for office again. 
If he remains Governor, which is what Florida voters assumed, it would be a 
whole different story â€¦ . JUST SAYIN ' - But who knows?
