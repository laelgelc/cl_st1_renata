 It is time that Sioux Falls looks at developing deeper, more consistent 
relationships with key Chinese communities and businesses. Both the city 
leaders of Guangzhou and Shenzhen—with populations of 20 million 
each—expressed interest in forming some government partnership between Sioux 
Falls and one of their city districts. One of our largest 
employers—Smithfield Foods—is owned by a Chinese parent company, and my 
office has had several other discussions with business development 
opportunities that have Chinese ownership ties. The Sioux Falls economy would 
strengthen via stronger cultural and business relations with key Chinese 
partners. **#xteam_h** **#dt47_h** **#truthtrain_h** **#phpnews_h** **#tcd_h**
