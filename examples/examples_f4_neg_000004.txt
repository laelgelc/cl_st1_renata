Nobody wanted to secure our elections ahead of 2024 , and now some of you also 
want to push away potential Trump voters because some people aren ' t moral 
enough for you or whatever lame reason you come up with. We [ not me ] chose to 
play the game of outvote the steal, and now that we need every vote that 
counts, some of us want to push people away. Republican voters don ' t know how 
to win. As I ' ve said and will say once more, I am not a Republican, 
conservative, or any other term; I support Trump the person and the MAGA 
movement he has started.
