4 days ago my mom had a stroke. She ' s doing very well right now, but the 
first few days turned our lives upside down. So many things were brought to 
light for me when this started Monday night. I ' m trying to take my time and 
figure out what I truly feel and truly want to say about everything without 
being reactionary in the moment, because it ' s been a roller coaster of 
emotions. I ' ve written and deleted and re-written and deleted this message 
about a dozen times. For over 5 years I have dedicated and devoted my entire 
life to trying to save our country. What happened to my mom this week 
highlighted the insanity of the problems that exist within the structures of 
the conservative movement and how the conservative movement treats its very 
best workers and activists. Perhaps it ' s better that I go live with all of 
you later today or tomorrow to talk about all of this and explain how I ' m 
feeling.
