Brian Stelter going to Harvard to teach about threats to democracy is another 
egregious example of the powerful, elite class of buffoons in this country who 
continually fail upwards, ascending to greater and greater positions of power 
and influence despite their unadulterated real threat to democracy isn ' t 
Trump, his supporters or conservative media. It ' s this class of 
pseudo-educated dunces who control cultural, financial and political levers of 
power.
