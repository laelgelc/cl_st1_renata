Breitbart News: Rep. Byron Donalds declared that Donald Trump won the first GOP 
presidential primary debate without participating in it. It ' s a one-person 
race with a lot of other people in the race, he explained. In the grand scheme, 
Donald Trump ' s the winner of this debate. Nobody on that stage, from what I 
saw, really galvanized Republicans in a way that you can then directly 
challenge Donald Trump.
