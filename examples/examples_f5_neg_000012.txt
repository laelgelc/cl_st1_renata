DC_Draino@DC_DrainoAOC is claiming Elon interfered with the 2022 midterm 
elections by altering X ' s algorithmsI mean, it ' s not like he banned Trump 
and 100 , 000+ of his top supporters, shadow banned truthful posts about 
Democrat corruption, and suppressed the Hunter Biden laptop storyâ€¦But Elon 
actually didn ' t even change the algos until *after* the midtermsHe kept them 
in place u til after the midterms and the GOP still took the HouseAOC is trying 
to rewrite history with more lies to justify more regime tyranny and censorship 
- remember her fabricated J6 stories? 2024 will be the first major election 
where we have free speech on XAnd we will likely have 3+ SCOTUS 1A decisions 
coming by July that will protect free speech on other Big Tech platforms as 
well
