Thank you to Jordan Peterson for shedding light at the Subcommittee on 
Weaponization of the Federal Government, on Biden ' s collusion with big banks 
to spy on Americans ' financial privacy! The danger posed by this increasing 
ability of governments and large corporations to collude threatens everyone ' s 
freedom equally, Peterson testified. It could well be at the moment—and I 
think this is the point Republicans here are trying to make—is that the 
people in the sights of that collusion tend to have more conservative leanings, 
but that will shift in a moment whenever the political tides shift. - Dr. 
Jordan B. Peterson
