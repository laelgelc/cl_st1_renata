The left has us talking about the Bloodbath Hoax today instead of focusing on 
election integrity and ballot chasing, the invasion at our Southern Border, and 
how median income Americans can no longer afford to buy a home thanks to 
Bidenomics. The SCOTUS free speech cases are critical to defending our 
constitutional rights. These two cases, NRA v. Vullo and Missouri v. Biden, 
could be two where Trump ' s SCOTUS picks will be at their most important. Had 
we had three Hillary picks, and we might get radically anti-speech rulings. 
That is the way the left is trending, and all the more reason why Trump MUST 
win in November.
