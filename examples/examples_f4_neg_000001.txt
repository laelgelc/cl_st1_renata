I ' ve been working to improve my shooting skills ever since I got my first 
training at CIA 20 years ago. Sure, shooting is a hobby now, but I also 
recognize that real self-defense requires practice and proficiency. I ' m 
fortunate to have elite shooter friends who train me so I can work on 
fundamental skills. And I also know that, if I ever have to defend myself with 
a weapon, Patriot Defender has my back. Go to y provide concealed carry legal 
defense to members- along with other categories like free speech defense, and 
defense against partisan government weaponization. You need someone to have 
your back these days- and that ' s Patriot Defender. Join today at
