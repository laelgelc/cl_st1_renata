police_car_light_e Statement from AFL President @StephenM in response to the 
politically-motivated New York v. Trump verdict: This is evil communist 
lawfare—a vile, hideous, disfiguring attack on American democracy and 
American elections. Joe Biden and the Left are systematically demolishing and 
dismantling American institutions in their ruthless pursuit of power. President 
Trump is being subjected to Marxist oppression, the likes of which we ' d never 
thought we would see in this country. All our rules smashed and broken. Justice 
in tatters. The Constitution set ablaze. A sad, sad day for freedom and for 
America. This is the road to serfdom — unless this Marxist lawfare is 
stopped, halted, and reversed and democracy restored.
