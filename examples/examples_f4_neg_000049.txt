I find it hilarious, but also incredibly maddening that people will go out of 
their way to blatantly plagiarize, and steal other peoples hard is probably the 
MOST egregious example I ' ve seen in a LONG time…The first picture is the 
logo from our inaugural event in 2021 , the Patriot Roundup, that @QueenAnonAmy 
and I designed from scratch with our artist. To boot, Sumter County GOP had 
Tomi Lahren, and Sheriff David Clarke speak in front of OUR logo…How EVABLE.
