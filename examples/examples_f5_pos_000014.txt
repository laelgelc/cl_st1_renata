Uvalde mayor slams state law enforcement for cover-up in school shooting 
investigationIt ' s been since May 24 that a deranged shooter took the lives of 
nineteen children and two adults in a mass shooting at Robb Elementary School 
in Uvalde, Texas. An investigation is still underway and the public long ago
