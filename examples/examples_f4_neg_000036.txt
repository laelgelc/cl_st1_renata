I have a vision of a Republican Party that truly serves the American people and 
our many great House GOP conference all suffered together so much in the past 
two years and many House Republicans have changed and moved to the right, but 
the base doesn ' t know is an example:The Senate Republicans are another story 
& the 18 Senators that voted for the Democrats $1 . 7 trillion omnimonster are 
the Uniparty, 36 % of Republican Senators.
