 The Democrat Party is threatened by people whose economic circumstances 
improve to the point that they do not need government first and foremost. That 
' s a threat. But this happens when the U. S. economy is humming. There is a 
lot of upward mobility, and people leave the lower depths of poverty and start 
traversing a pathway through the middle class to the upper middle class, and as 
they leave, the Democrats have to replace them. That is what illegal 
immigration has been since 1965 when Ted Kennedy reintroduced the whole concept 
after 40 years of no immigration from 1921 to 1965 . - Rush Limbaugh
